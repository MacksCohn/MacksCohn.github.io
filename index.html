            <p class = 'portal'>
            I would consider Portal 2 the best puzzle game of all time. 
            A sequel to another great game, Portal 2 expands on the story
            of the last game and introduces a two brilliant new characters
            in Wheatley and Cave Johnson. Its puzzles are amazing; I can 
            consistently come back to the game after a couple years and 
            still feel like I am working hard to find the solution
            every time. This was also one of the first full video 
            games I ever played, so it will always hold a special place
            in my heart.</p>
            <p class = 'gungeon'>
            Enter the Gungeon is a roguelite game, meaning that every
            time you lose you have to restart from the beginning with
            none of the items or perks you earned during that run. At
            first, this was too brutal for me, and I gave up. This 
            was one of the first games that made me realize that I could
            find joy in the act of improving at a difficult game. Notably,
            the game expands as you play. As you improve and do better on 
            each floor, you unlock items that you can have the chance to
            find in future runs. The game's art style is also very charming.
            </p>
            <p class = 'darkSouls'>
            Dark Souls is famously a very difficult game. While this is 
            certainly true, it is mainly because the game requires 
            immense focus and understanding. The premise is simple. You
            are an undead who needs to defeat a bunch of strong opponents 
            in order to regain your humanity. This game has a great 
            memory attached to it&mdash;I remember I played it for the first
            time while two of my friends who had already played the game 
            watched me and gave me tips. This was the night after our 
            high school senior banquet and we played all night long until
            the sun came up. It helps that it was such a brilliant game
            that really teaches the value of dedication and practice.
            </p>
            <p class = 'inscryption'>
            Inscryption is a funny game to explain. It is important when
            talking about this game to avoid any possibility of spoilers.
            while the game appears to be a simple card game battler, it 
            soon becomes an escape room, and then changes even more. The 
            core gameplay of the card game is invigorating to master, and
            the story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I 
            highly recommend anyone and everyone to play this game, and 
            I had many people play it just to see how they react to the
            incredible story.
            </p>

            <p class = 'stardew'>
            Stardew Valley is a wonderfully cute game about inheriting a
            decrepit farm in a small town. You get to know the 
            townsfolk, clean up your farm, and explore the surprisingly
            vast world. I loved playing this game and trying to make as
            much money as I could in a limited amount of time. I now love
            this game because it is one of the few games that my lovely
            girlfriend also plays. The game released a multiplayer mode
            somewhat recently, which has allowed us to have fun together
            in this cozy farming simulator.
            </p> 
            <p class = 'sekiro'>
            Sekiro is a game similar to Dark Souls. Your goal is to defeat
            a list of difficult enemies. Both games are made by From Software.
            However with Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Miyazaki (the game's director)
            changed the gameplay completely from that of Dark Souls. 
            Instead of rolling to avoid the attacks of enemies, you are
            asked to 'parry' every blow by timing a button press exactly
            when an attack would have hit you. After enough parries, the 
            enemy becomes staggered and you are able to perform a high 
            damage move. I found this game incredibly worthwhile to play
            and I also enjoyed the pursuit towards perfection that this
            game challenges the player with. For a wonderful video on this
            see <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W4li9yfY3o'>here</a>.
            </p>
            <p class = 'hollowKnight'>
            Hollow Knight is the first "Metroidvania" game I have ever
            played that truly caught my attention and kept it. For those
            unaware, a Metroidvania merges the gameplay of the original
            Metroid games and the Castlevania games. For those who are 
            still in the dark, (basically everyone) what this usually
            entails is places in the world that are clearly inaccessible
            will show up, and the goal is to get an item that lets you
            access that place and come back. Hollow Knight also is a
            difficult game. In a similar vein to the From Software 
            games, the bosses (stronger enemies) in the game will
            ask of you more than you think yourself capable of. Half of
            the joy of this game comes from proving yourself wrong about
            that. An honorable mention for a similar type of game I enjoyed
            but have not yet finished: Check out <a target='_blank' href='https://www.animalwell.net/'>Animal Well</a>
            </p>
            <p class = 'noita'>
            Noita is a game of knowledge. You begin a very weak, very
            flimsy wizard. It feels as if a small breeze might tear you
            apart. But as the game goes on, you gather stronger spells,
            stronger wands, and more knowledge of how the world works.
            During this game I went from seeing a spell and not understanding
            how to make it do more than a few damage, to being able to
            create the sun. I mean that literally. I created two stars in
            this game and then brought one to Heaven and one to Hell.
            I love this game so much. Here is an image of my character 
            with the crown you get for doing that 'Sun Quest':
            <br><img src='./images/noita-sun-proof.png'>
            </p>

            <p class = 'outerwilds'>
            Outer Wilds places you as an alien in dying universe. You
            are stuck in a time loop that occurs when the star you 
            call the sun goes supernova. Your goal is to translate the
            writing of an ancient civilization that seems to have built
            the very time loop you are in in order to find out what is
            going on. This game is all about figuring out what to do and
            how. Amazingly, once you know everything there is to learn,
            you are able to beat the game in just about 20 minutes. 
            The DLC (expansion that adds content) for this game is also
            incredibly amazing and gives the same feeling that the original
            game gives you&mdash;a sort of nostalgia for the time before
            you knew what to do. This game can only be experienced once,
            and that is amazing.
            </p>
            <p class = 'terraria'>
            Terraria is a game that is built so you can sink hours and hours
            into it, and that I have. It is a similar concept to Minecraft,
            where you mine for resources and craft items and build. However,
            Terraria is 2D and has much larger emphasis on skillful combat.
            I enjoyed playing it alone when I was a bit younger. It does 
            lose a couple points in my mind now because my friends are 
            much less fans of this game than they are of terraria. I would
            love to play this game with a big group of friends someday.
            </p>
            <p class = 'botw'>
            The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild earned its title as game
            of the year when it came out. It was an innovative spin on the 
            Zelda formula that was designed perfectly for the Nintendo Switch
            and its in-and-out playstyle. I remember playing this game and 
            messaging my friends who were also playing it about the places
            we found and the puzzles we solved. For those who have played it
            Eventide Island was a very memorable part of this game, and I
            believe it was ingenious game design.
            </p>
            <p class = 'minecraft'>
            Everybody knows Minecraft, so I will spare you the details with
            this one. Go play Minecraft. If you get bored. Add mods (modifications)
            to the game. If you get bored again, play with some friends, add some 
            more mods, or both!
